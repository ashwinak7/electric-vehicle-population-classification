# 🚗 Electric Vehicle Population Classification

This project focuses on **analyzing and classifying electric vehicle (EV) population data** using machine learning techniques.
The goal is to clean real-world EV data, perform exploratory analysis, visualize insights, and build classification models.

## 📌 Project Overview

Electric vehicles are rapidly growing worldwide. This project helps understand EV population patterns through:
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualization of trends
- Machine learning classification

Implemented using **Python** in a **Jupyter Notebook**.
